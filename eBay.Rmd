#c. Log Regression

#Control group (0), Treatment (1). Treatment shown ads BEFORE treatment period and NOT after (0). Control group shown ads before and after.
# Hypothesis: Revenue will decrease from the treatment group after the treatment period ends. We hypothesize that removing ads will lead to a decrease in ad revenue.
#Combinations: 0/0 (control, before) 0/1 (control, after)
# 1/0 (treatment, before) 1/1 (treatment, after)

ebay_log = lm(log(revenue) ~ factor(isTreatmentGroup) + factor(isTreatmentPeriod), data = ebay)
summary(ebay_log)


```
The p-value for the treatment period is very significant (0.00821) with a 99% percent confidence interval. 

The intercept represents the revenue of the control group in the before period, which is a starting point of $10.96. As shown in the previous frequency and proportion tables, there are 3468 members in this group, or 14.6% of the entire group (control and treatment before and after). 

The incercept for the treatment group before the treatment (1/0) is $10.95 (intercept minus "isTreatmentGroup1", 10.95 - 0.01047). This is a slightly lower intercept than the control group, suggesting that the treatment group begins with slightly less ad revenue. However, as shown by the insignificant p-value (0.53), we can deduce that the difference is not meaningful. 

The intercept for the treatment group during the treatment period is $10.91 (treatment before period - treatment after: 10.95 - 0.42). Additionally, with a very significant p-value of (0.00821) at the 99% confidence interval level, we see that removing ads may play a factor in decreasing revenue.

#Regression with DMA
