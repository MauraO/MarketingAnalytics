## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

#c. Log Regression

#Control group (0), Treatment (1). Treatment shown ads BEFORE treatment period and NOT after (0). Control group shown ads before and after.
# Hypothesis: Revenue will decrease from the treatment group after the treatment period ends. We hypothesize that removing ads will lead to a decrease in ad revenue.
#Combinations: 0/0 (control, before) 0/1 (control, after)
# 1/0 (treatment, before) 1/1 (treatment, after)

ebay_log = lm(log(revenue) ~ factor(isTreatmentGroup) + factor(isTreatmentPeriod), data = ebay)
summary(ebay_log)

```
The p-value for the treatment period is very significant (0.00821) with a 99% percent confidence interval. 

```{r}

#Pre treatment regression

ebay_pre = lm(log(revenue) ~ factor(isTreatmentGroup) + factor(isTreatmentPeriod=="0"), data = ebay)
summary(ebay_pre)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
